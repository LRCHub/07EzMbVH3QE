I was there when the little kids
Were doing there Heya Heya Hey
Dancing around in a circle
Doing their snake dance Heya Heya Hey

Haya Heya Heya Heya Heya Heya Heya Heya Hey
Heya Heya Heya Heya Heya Heya Heya Heya Hey

I had a jacked fom the back of a box
Oh oh oh oh oh...
A warrior and a hunter where my only friends

Oh oh oh oh oh...

Heya Heya Heya...
Heya Heya Heya...

I want to be a civilized man
But no one is sane enough
To show me how I can

Heya Heya...
Heya Heya...

Fishing along the San Juan River
Smoking driftwood

Oh oh oh oh...

I was there when the little kids
Were doing their Heya Heya Hey
